# Claude Skills - Simple User Guide
### (The "I'm Not Super Tech-Savvy" Version)

## What Are Skills? (ELI5 - Explain Like I'm 5)

Think of Claude like a really smart assistant. Now imagine giving that assistant specialized training manuals for specific jobs. That's what Skills are!

**Without Skills:** Claude is like a general helper - good at many things, but not an expert at anything specific.

**With Skills:** Claude becomes like hiring a specialist - an expert designer, a professional document creator, a web tester, etc.

### Real World Analogy
- **No Skills** = Asking a friend for help making a poster
- **With Skills** = Asking a professional graphic designer with all their tools and templates

3. **Features** - Access to advanced capabilities you wouldn't get otherwise
